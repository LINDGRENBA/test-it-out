|  3. If you are comfortable with the command line, you can copy the project link and clone it through your commad line with the command `git clone`. Otherwise, I recommend choosing "**Download ZIP**".   |   ![Download ZIP option on GitHub](img/readme/download-zip.PNG)  |   
|   4. Once the ZIP file has finished downloading, you can right click on the file to view the zip folder in your downloads.   |   ![ZIP folder in downloads](img/readme/zip-folder.PNG)  |   
|  5. Right click on the project ZIP folder that you have just downloaded and choose the option "**Copy To...**", then choose the location where you would like to save this folder.    |   ![Saving ZIP to new location with 'Copy To'](img/readme/copy-to.PNG)  |
